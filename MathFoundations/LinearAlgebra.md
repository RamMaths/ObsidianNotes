**Algebra**: It's arithmetic that includes non-numerical entities like $x$

If it has an exponential term, it isn't linear algebra...
$2x^2 + 25 = 25$
$2\sqrt{x} + 5 = 25$

**Linear algebra**: Solving for unknowns within system of linear equations.

Example: 
- Sheriff has $180 km/h$ car. 
- Bank robber has $150 km/h$ car and five minute head-start
- How long does it take the sheriff to catch the robber?
- What distance will they have traveled at that point?

We can solve this problem graphically...

Or we can solve it algebraically 

### Equation 1
We can represent the first equation like the following since the car is going at 2.5 $km/min$

Equation 1: $d = 2.5t$

### Equation 2
We can do something similar with this equation, but here it's not growing like the equation 1 because we are 5 min ahead, that's why we do the following

Equation 2: $d = 3 (t-5)$

Then we solve the equation system.
...
$2.5t=3(t-5)$
$2.5t=3t-15$
$2.5t - 3t = -15$
$-0.5t = -15$
$t=$$-15\over-0.5$
$t=$$30(min)$
